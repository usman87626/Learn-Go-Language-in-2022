# Learn-Go-Language

This repository contains code that I wrote during Golang Learning. You can use it to revise your concepts & even use it to learn Go Language.
The repo will be updated time to time.

## How to Run
1. Install [Go Language](https://go.dev/doc/install)
2. Open the folder that you want to run in VS Code or any editor you like
3. Use the command: `go run main.go`
